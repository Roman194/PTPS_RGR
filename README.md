# PTPS_RGR <br/>
This project is about optimization of network vizualization from "Programming Collective Intelligense" book by Toby Segaran (136 p.). <br/>
It's my interpritation of the example from network vizualization chapter on Java language with Swing framework. <br/>

## Used features <br/>
- Random search method (for search of the most optimal solution) <br/>
- Mass and spring algorithm (for search the count of cross the lines by each other for every possible solution) <br/>
- Swing (to draw the most optimal solution) <br/>

## Screenshots <br/>
